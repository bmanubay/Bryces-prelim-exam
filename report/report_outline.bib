	abstract = {The continued development and utility of molecular dynamics simulations requires improvements in both the physical models used (force fields) and in our ability to sample the Boltzmann distribution of these models. Recent developments in both areas have made available multi-microsecond simulations of two proteins, ubiquitin and Protein G, using a number of different force fields. Although these force fields mostly share a common mathematical form, they differ in their parameters and in the philosophy by which these were derived, and previous analyses showed varying levels of agreement with experimental NMR data. To complement the comparison to experiments, we have performed a structural analysis of and comparison between these simulations, thereby providing insight into the relationship between force-field parameterization, the resulting ensemble of conformations and the agreement with experiments. In particular, our results show that, at a coarse level, many of the motional properties are preserved across several, though not all, force fields. At a finer level of detail, however, there are distinct differences in both the structure and dynamics of the two proteins, which can, together with comparison with experimental data, help to select force fields for simulations of proteins. A noteworthy observation is that force fields that have been reparameterized and improved to provide a more accurate energetic description of the balance between helical and coil structures are difficult to distinguish from their “unbalanced” counterparts in these simulations. This observation implies that simulations of stable, folded proteins, even those reaching 10 microseconds in length, may provide relatively little information that can be used to modify torsion parameters to achieve an accurate balance between different secondary structural elements.},

	abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) and related methods are close to becoming routine computational tools for drug discovery. Their main advantage is in explicitly treating structural flexibility and entropic effects. This allows a more accurate estimate of the thermodynamics and kinetics associated with drug–target recognition and binding, as better algorithms and hardware architectures increase their use. Here, we review the theoretical background of MD and enhanced sampling methods, focusing on free-energy perturbation, metadynamics, steered MD, and other methods most consistently used to study drug–target binding. We discuss unbiased MD simulations that nowadays allow the observation of unsupervised ligand–target binding, assessing how these approaches help optimizing target affinity and drug residence time toward improved drug efficacy. Further issues discussed include allosteric modulation and the role of water molecules in ligand binding and optimization. We conclude by calling for more prospective studies to attest to these methods’ utility in discovering novel drug candidates.},

	abstract = {Protein dynamics on the atomic level and on the microsecond timescale has recently become accessible from both computation and experiment. To validate molecular dynamics (MD) at the submicrosecond timescale against experiment we present microsecond MD simulations in 10 different force-field configurations for two globular proteins, ubiquitin and the gb3 domain of protein G, for which extensive NMR data is available. We find that the reproduction of the measured NMR data strongly depends on the chosen force field and electrostatics treatment. Generally, particle-mesh Ewald outperforms cut-off and reaction-field approaches. A comparison to measured J-couplings across hydrogen bonds suggests that there is room for improvement in the force-field description of hydrogen bonds in most modern force fields. Our results show that with current force fields, simulations beyond hundreds of nanoseconds run an increased risk of undergoing transitions to nonnative conformational states or will persist within states of high free energy for too long, thus skewing the obtained population frequencies. Only for the AMBER99sb force field have such transitions not been observed. Thus, our results have significance for the interpretation of data obtained with long MD simulations, for the selection of force fields for MD studies and for force-field development. We hope that this comprehensive benchmark based on NMR data applied to many popular MD force fields will serve as a useful resource to the MD community. Finally, we find that for gb3, the force-field AMBER99sb reaches comparable accuracy in back-calculated residual dipolar couplings and J-couplings across hydrogen bonds to ensembles obtained by refinement against NMR data.},

	abstract = {We report on the use of large-scale distributed computing simulation and novel analysis techniques for examining the dynamics of a small protein. Matters addressed include folding rate, very long time scale kinetics, ensemble properties, and interaction with water. The target system for the study, the villin headpiece, has been of great interest to experimentalists and theorists both. Sampling totaled nearly 500 μ s —the most extensive published to date for a system of villin’s size in explicit solvent with all atom detail—and was in the form of tens of thousands of independent molecular dynamics trajectories, each several tens of nanoseconds in length. We report on kinetics sensitivity analyses that, using a set of short simulations, probed the role of water in villin’s folding and sensitivity to the simulation’s electrostatics treatment. By constructing Markovian state models (MSMs) from the collected data, we were able to propagate dynamics to times far beyond those directly simulated and to rapidly compute mean first passage times, long time kinetics (tens of microseconds), and evolution of ensemble property distributions over long times, otherwise currently impossible. We also tested our MSM by using it to predict the structure of villin de novo.},

	abstract = {In order to evaluate the transferability of existing empirical force fields for all-atom molecular simulations of protein adsorption behavior, we have developed and applied a method to calculate the adsorption free energy (ΔGads) of model peptides on functionalized surfaces for comparison with available experimental data. Simulations were conducted using the CHARMM program and force field using a host−guest peptide with the sequence TGTG-X-GTGT (where G and T are glycine and threonine amino acid residues, respectively, with X representing valine, threonine, aspartic acid, phenylalanine or lysine) over nine different functionalized alkanethiol self-assembled monolayer (SAM) surfaces with explicitly represented solvent. ΔGads was calculated using biased-energy replica exchange molecular dynamics to adequately sample the conformational states of the system. The simulation results showed that the CHARMM force-field was able to represent ΔGads within 1 kcal/mol of the experimental values for most systems, while deviations as large as 4 kcal/mol were found for others. In particular, the simulations reveal that CHARMM underestimates the strength of adsorption on the hydrophobic and positively charged amine surfaces. These results clearly show that improvements in force field parameterization are needed in order to accurately represent interactions between amino acid residues and functional groups of a surface and they provide a means for force field evaluation and modification for the eventual development and validation of an interfacial force field for the accurate simulation of protein adsorption behavior.},

We found that, if transferred parameters are used in a parametrized force field, the calculation quality is no longer superior to that of a generic force field. To achieve high quality in predictions, new parameters should be created from ab initio data whenever necessary. We investigated this approach and found that a custom-built force field can be made to reproduce ab initio results if parameters are derived specifically for the molecules of interest. The parametrization procedure was applied to a group of classic antibacterial drug molecules, the sulfonamides.},

Using these force field parameters we obtained some adsorption isotherms at cryogenic temperatures that at first sight were in discrepancies with experimental values for certain molecules and structures. We attribute these discrepancies to the sensitiveness of the equipment and to kinetic impedimenta that can lead to erratic results. Additional problems can be found during simulations when extra-framework cations are present in the system as their lack of mobility at low temperatures could lead to kinetic effects that hinder experimental adsorption.},
