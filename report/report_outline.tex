\section{Outline}
\subsection{Objectives $\left(0.5 pages\right)$}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is fast becoming a more useful tool in many scientific studies.
 \item However, some limitations remain in the ability of MD force fields to accurately and transferably describe molecular environments.
 \item Currently, force fields are parameterized with fixed functional forms with, often, poor physical motivation and require the chemical intuition of experts to manually correct parameters, leading to a more suitable product. Additionally, the creation of a transferable method to update existing force fields based on new experimental data is limited due to lack of understanding and lack of consistency in how the original parameterization was done 
 \item A possible solution to these problems is by recasting the force field parameterization process as a bayesian inference problem.
 \item The objective of this paper is introduce a framework for using high quality experimental data in order to automatically generate families of MD force fields consistent with the data used.
 \item In this paper I will describe the overall parameterization framework and my roles in the project, first, collecting and organizing large amounts of high quality thermochemical data and, currently, investigating use of the Multistate Bennett Acceptance Ratio (MBAR) as a means to improve throughput by reducing simulation requirements during the parameterization process.      
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Significance $\left(0.5 pages\right)$}
\begin{itemize}
 \item A broad variety of research has been greatly impacted by the advent and improvement of MD simulation tools.  
  \begin{itemize}
   \item Observing physical phenomena at a molecular scale (phase changes, ligand docking, etc.)\cite{villin}
   \item Drug discovery and deisgn of new molecules\cite{drug_discov}
  \end{itemize}
 \item The fundamental part of molecular simulation for describing the energetic interactions of a system is referred to as a force field, hence transferable and quantitatively accurate force fields are imperative for the use of molecular simulation tools to continue to proliferate.
  \begin{itemize}
   \item Transferability of MD force fields and particularly sets of parameters is an extremely popular topic (and current limitation) in the molecular simulation field.\cite{transferability1,transferability2,transferability3,transferability4} Transferability encourages use by providing convenience for scientists with wide arrays of research interests and simplifying the mystery that most observe force fields with.
   \item Inaccurate and poorly parameterized force fields have been shown to grossly misrepresent molecular systems\cite{ffcomp1,ffcomp2}
  \end{itemize}
 \item A few notable attempts, such as GAAMP and ForceBalance, have been made in recent years towards more automated and systematic force field parameterization methods.\cite{GAAMP,FB1,FB2,FB3} Each made important contributions to automated force field parameterization through clever use of objective function optimization, exploiting a variety of fitting data and allowing exploration of functional forms. However none provided the ability for the computer to automatically and systematically explore choices of fitting data, optimization algorithm and functional forms in order to objectively find families of force fields consistent with fitting data and reward those with the least model complexity.  
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Background and related literature $\left(1.5 pages \pm 0.5 pages\right)$}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Molecular dynamics force fields define how we construct the potential energy functions (and thereby the forces) of an atomistic system under study. The potential is constructed such that it is a function of solely the atomic coordinates and a set of parameters associated with the force field. Transferable force fields generally have three major parts: 
 \begin{itemize}
  \item [1] The \textbf{functional forms} of the potential, i.e. the mathematical equations for the energy equation. A classic example of a non-bonded interaction form is the 12-6 Lennard-Jones potential.  
  \item [2] \textbf{Atom types} which describe similar chemical environments such that we can assign different atoms identical parameters, thereby shrinking the parameter space and helping to avoid overfitting.
  \item [3] \textbf{Parameters} that are associated with one or many atom types which determine the magnitude of the interactions in the system 
 \end{itemize}
 \item As alluded to earlier, there are severe limitations in current methods for force field parameterization. Until very recently, force fields have primarily been made manually guided by experimental and quantum chemical simulation data as well as the intuition of expert computational chemists.
