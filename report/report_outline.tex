\section{Objectives}
Molecula  dynamics (MD) simulation is fast becoming a more useful tool in many scientific studies. 
However, some limitations remain in the ability of MD force fields to accurately and transferably 
describe molecular environments. Many popular and currently used force fields were parameterized 
with fixed functional forms which, often, have poor physical motivation. The chemical intuition of 
experts is also often required to manually correct parameters, leading to a more suitable product. 
Additionally, the creation of a transferable method to update existing force fields based on new 
experimental data is limited due to lack of understanding and lack of consistency in how the original 
parameterizations were done.

A possible solution to these problems is by recasting the force field parameterization process as a 
bayesian inference problem. The objective of this paper is introduce a framework for using high quality 
experimental data in order to automatically generate families of MD force fields consistent with the data 
used. In this paper I will generally describe the overall parameterization framework and my roles in the project 
thus far. First, collecting and curating large amounts of high quality experimental thermochemical data 
and, currently, investigating use of the Multistate Bennett Acceptance Ratio (MBAR) as a means to improve 
parameterization throughput by reducing computational expense while making updates to the posterior distribution 
of parameter sets consistent with experimental data provided.

\section{Significance}
A broad variety of research from drug discovery to metallurgy has been greatly impacted by the advent and 
improvement of MD simulation tools. Observing physical phenomena such as protein folding dynamics and ligand 
docking at a molecular scale is widely studied using MD tools.\cite{villin,villin2} Drug discovery and deisgn 
of new pharmaceutical leads has also been made more efficient.\cite{drug_discov} The fundamental part in molecular 
simulation for describing the energetic interactions of a system is referred to as a force field. Hence, 
the development of force fields which are readily transferable between dissimilar physical systems and are 
quantitatively accurate is imperative for the use of molecular simulation tools to continue to proliferate.

Transferability of MD force fields, and particularly sets of force field parameters, is an extremely popular 
topic (and current limitation) in the molecular simulation field.\cite{transferability1,transferability2,
transferability3,transferability4} Transferability of force fields encourages use by providing convenience 
for scientists with wide arrays of research interests and by making parameter space less complex through 
generalization by chemical similarity. Inaccurate and poorly parameterized force fields have been shown to 
grossly misrepresent molecular systems.\cite{ffcomp1,ffcomp2,robustness} 

A few notable attempts, such as GAAMP and ForceBalance, have been made in recent years towards the development of more automated and systematic 
force field parameterization methods.\cite{GAAMP,FB1,FB2,FB3} Each made important contributions to automated 
force field parameterization through clever use of objective function optimization, exploiting a variety of 
fitting data and allowing exploration of functional forms. However, none provided the ability for the computer 
to automatically and systematically explore choices of fitting data, optimization algorithm and functional 
forms in order to objectively find families of force fields consistent with fitting data and reward those with 
the least model complexity. The bayesian inference scheme described in this paper will provide a workflow for 
discovering families of force field parameters consistent with experimental data and a variety of functional forms.

Additionally, as I will demonstrate later in my discussion of data mining and curation of the NIST ThermoML database,
the chemical diversity in readily available thermochemical databases is lacking. Not only that, but the distribution of data
amongst commonly measured properties is heavily skewed towards certain properties. Having learned this since beginning the
project, one of the potential uses of the parameterization scheme is to fill in the many gaps in experimental thermochemical 
data. With updated general descriptions of chemical space and property data on chemically similar compounds, this parameterization
process should provide force fields to accurately simulate property data for which no experimental data exists. 

\section{Background and related literature $\left(1.5 pages \pm 0.5 pages\right)$}
Molecular dynamics force fields define how to construct the potential energy functions (and thereby the forces) 
of an atomistic system under study. The potential is constructed such that it is a function of solely the atomic 
coordinates and a set of parameters associated with the force field. Transferable force fields generally have 
three major parts: 
  \begin{itemize}
   \item [1] The \textbf{functional forms} of the potential, i.e. the mathematical equations for the energy equation. A classic example of a non-bonded interaction form is the 12-6 Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential.   
   \item [2] \textbf{Atom types} which describe similar chemical environments such that one can assign different atoms (or series of atoms) identical parameters, thereby shrinking the parameter space and helping to avoid overfitting.
   \item [3] \textbf{Parameters} that are associated with one or many atom types which determine the magnitude of the interactions in the system 
  \end{itemize}
Rolled into functional forms, \textbf{combining rules} are also sometimes considered. \textbf{Combining rules} describe how to combine parameters 
when an interaction contains multiple atom types.

There are severe limitations in current methods for force field parameterization. Until very 
recently, force fields have primarily been made manually, guided by experimental and quantum chemical simulation 
data as well as the intuition of expert computational chemists.\cite{charmm1,charmm2,mm2,mmff,amber} Some functional 
forms used in modern force fields, like the 12-6 LJ potential, have poor physical basis. While the attractive term 
of the LJ potential has physical basis on the true behavior of dispersion forces, the repulsive term loosely 
approximates Pauli repulsion and is used for computational convenience. Despite attempts at improvement, many of 
the functional forms and parameters of popular force fields remain mostly unchanged due to the lack of clear, 
systematic methods for updating them.\cite{unchanged}

Parameterization methods have slowly become more sophisticated over the last decade and a 
half with advances in computational power and to accommodate modeling increasingly more complex systems. Many early 
force fields were parameterized manually for narrow classes of molecules with large redundant parameter spaces.\cite{mm1} Force fields like AMBER 
\textit{parm94} showed intuitive departure by shrinking parameter space with clever atom typing defined by expert 
computational chemists.\cite{parm94} The parameterization of GAFF used a semi-automated genetic algorithm approach 
to select parameters.\cite{amber} Even more sophisticated optimization approaches such as least-squares optimization 
of an objective function have been utilized in the creation of the TIP4P-Ew water model\cite{tip4pew} and in the 
ForceBalance parameterization scheme\cite{FB1,FB2,FB3}. Even with these more sophisticated optimization schemes there 
are still issues in needing for the user to assign weights to different kinds of data (i.e. different properties) when 
they are included in the same objective function. Molecular systems aren't necessarily uniquely defined by a single 
parameter set. There are possibilities of multiple optima in parameter space (i.e. different sets of parameters that 
all are consistent with data used during parameterization) and least-squares optimization does not discriminate the 
global optima from the other possibilities.

Bayesian inference provides a robust statistical framework for force field parameterization. It has been shown that 
bayesian approaches can be applied to a wide variety of data driven sciences. It's been used for balancing data to 
help minimize influence of oversampled populations and generate more robust predictive models\cite{bayes_imbalance} 
to recalibrating initial force estimates in coarse grained MD models to target atomistic MD and experimental data
\cite{bayes_coarse}. Baye's theorem clearly provides a framework for the problem at hand thusly:
\begin{equation} P\left(\theta|D\right) \propto P\left(D|\theta\right) P\left(\theta\right)\end{equation}\\*
In \textbf{Equation (1)}, consider a model $M$ (including functional forms and atom types) with some unknown set of 
parameters which produced data $D$. $\theta$ is a choice of parameters consistent with data $D$. What \textbf{equation 
(1)} states is that the probability of $\theta$ given $D$ (the \textit{posterior}) can be determined from the probability 
of observing $D$ given $\theta$ (the \textit{likelihood function}) and the probability of $\theta$ (the \textit{prior}). The 
\textit{prior} is imposed by physical constraint or by the previous round of inference. Note that in 
iterative bayesian inference, the posterior of the previous round becomes the prior in the new iteration. This bayesian 
inference produces not just a single parameter set, but an entire posterior distribution of parameters given data. This is advantageous 
given that many different parameter sets can be consistent with the data used and the distribution of these consistent 
sets of parameters can inform what new data could help narrow the distribution and improve the parameter estimates.
